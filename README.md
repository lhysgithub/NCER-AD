# NCER-AD
Source code for the paper "NCER-AD: Noise-robust Clustering-enhanced Reconstruction-based Metrics Anomaly Detection in Microservices Systems"

### Get Started
1. Install Python3.7, PyTorch $\geq$ 1.4.0.
2. Download data to `dataset` folder. You can obtain four benchmarks from [Google Cloud](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gisthCoE-RrKJ0j3KPV7xiibhHWT9qRm?usp=sharing). All the datasets are well pre-processed. For the SWaT dataset, you can apply for it by following its official tutorial.
3. Train and evaluate. run `python main.py`. The result records are in the `res` directory.
